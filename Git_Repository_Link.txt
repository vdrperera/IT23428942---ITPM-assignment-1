## Verification Checklist

Before submission, verify:
- ✓ Repository is PUBLIC (not private)
- ✓ All files are uploaded:
  - swift-translator-tests.spec.js
  - playwright.config.js
  - package.json
  - README.md
  - .gitignore
- ✓ README.md shows correct installation instructions
- ✓ Repository can be cloned by others
- ✓ No personal information or sensitive data in commits

## Testing Repository Access

To verify your repository is publicly accessible:

1. Open a private/incognito browser window
2. Navigate to your repository URL
3. Confirm you can see all files without logging in
4. Try cloning: `git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL`

## Important Notes

- Repositories that cannot be accessed during marking will NOT be evaluated
- Ensure the repository remains PUBLIC until after grading
- The repository link should be provided in this text file during submission
- All project files must be in the root of the repository or clearly organized

## Troubleshooting

**If git push fails:**
- Verify you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Check if repository exists on GitHub
- Ensure repository is public
- Try: `git remote -v` to check remote URL is correct

**If repository shows as empty:**
- Ensure you ran `git add .` before commit
- Check `git status` to see tracked files
- Verify all files are committed: `git log`

## Submission Format

When submitting Assignment 1, include:
1. This text file with the repository URL filled in
2. The Test_Cases_Template.xlsx file
3. ZIP file containing all project files (as backup)
